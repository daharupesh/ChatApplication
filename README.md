# Android Chat Application

## Overview
This Android chat application is developed using **Kotlin** and follows the **MVVM** architecture pattern. It enables real-time communication between users with features like message sending and receiving, login and registration, and message display using **RecyclerView** and **CardView**. The backend is powered by **Firebase** for authentication and real-time database operations, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features
- **Login and Registration**: Users can register and log in to the app using email and password. Authentication is handled through Firebase.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly with the help of Firebase Realtime Database.
- **RecyclerView for Chat Display**: The chat messages are displayed in a clean, scrollable list using `RecyclerView` and `CardView` for individual message cards.
- **Firebase Integration**: 
  - **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with Firebase Authentication.
  - **Firebase Realtime Database**: Messages are stored and retrieved in real-time, ensuring instant communication.
- **XML for Layout Design**: The UI is designed using **XML**, ensuring a responsive and clean layout.
- **Kotlin Language**: The app is built using Kotlin, a modern and concise programming language for Android development.

## Project Structure
- **Login and Registration**: Users can register a new account or log in using an existing account. Firebase Authentication is used for secure user management.
- **Message Sending**: Users can send text messages to other users. These messages are stored in Firebase Realtime Database and displayed to all participants in real-time.
- **Message Display**: Messages are shown in a `RecyclerView` using `CardView`, which gives each message its own card for better readability.
- **Firebase**: Firebase handles authentication, database storage, and real-time synchronization between users.

## Technology Stack
- **Kotlin**: The primary language used for Android development.
- **XML**: Used for designing the UI layout.
- **RecyclerView**: For displaying chat messages in a list format.
